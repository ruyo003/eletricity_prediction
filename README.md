# eletricity_prediction

This Notebook analyzes two datasets: weather data (CSV) and energy data (CSV). The notebook explores the datasets individually and then merges them to create a combined dataset for prediction purposes.

Analysis Highlights:

Explores weather and energy datasets individually, 
identifies key insights and trends in the data, 
visualizes relationships between variables using graphs and charts and 
cleans and preprocesses the data for modeling.

Prediction Models:

Utilizes Random Forest Regressor and Gradient Boosting Regressor for prediction, 
trains and evaluates the models on the merged dataset and 
assesses model performance using appropriate metrics.

Requirements:

Python 3.x, 
Jupyter Notebook, and the 
required Python libraries (pandas, scikit-learn, statsmodels, seaborn, matplotlib, numpy)
Usage:

Clone the repository to your local machine.
Install the required Python libraries as mentioned above, 
Open the Jupyter Notebook (analysis_prediction.ipynb) and execute the cells to run the analysis and prediction.
Feel free to explore, modify, and extend the analysis as needed!
